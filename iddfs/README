The problem statement is to find if a node exists in a binary tree by using iterative deepending DFS .

A simple Node object has been implemented just for the same reason .
A basic BTree class with just the methods needed to implement this particular function has been written.

To terminate the iteration , a class variable is used to indicate that there are no more levels in the tree. 

Testng has been used to test positive/negative and null cases, by comparing data on the nodes , for which equals has been 

overridden.
A few variations of positive tests have been written to check nodes at various positions in the tree.
